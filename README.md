## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the TON Wallet Dashboard in two primary ways:

1.  **Connect Your Wallet**:
    Click the "Connect TON Wallet" button. This will prompt you to connect a compatible TON wallet via the TON Connect protocol. Once your wallet is successfully linked, its address will automatically populate, and the dashboard will begin displaying your real-time balance, transactions, and assets.

2.  **Enter a Manual Address**:
    If you'd like to explore data for any TON address without connecting your own wallet, simply paste the desired address into the provided input field. After entering the address, click "Search". The dashboard will then fetch and display the corresponding blockchain data for that address.

3.  **Explore Data**:
    Once an address is loaded, you can navigate through the various sections of the dashboard. View your current TON balance, browse a comprehensive list of transactions, discover your held Jetton tokens, and explore your unique NFT collection. Remember to use the refresh button on the balance card to ensure you're always viewing the latest data!
