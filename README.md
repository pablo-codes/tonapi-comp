# TON Wallet Dashboard üåê

A modern, real-time blockchain analytics dashboard for The Open Network (TON). This application provides a comprehensive overview of any TON wallet address, displaying current balance, transaction history, jetton token holdings, and NFT collections. Built with React and integrated with TON API, it offers a seamless and intuitive user experience for exploring on-chain data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pablo-codes/tonapi-comp.git
    cd tonapi-comp
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This project uses `process.env.REACT_APP_TON_API_KEY` for accessing the TON API.
    You will need to obtain an API key from [TON API](https://tonapi.io/).

    ```
    REACT_APP_TON_API_KEY=your_tonapi_key_here
    ```

    Replace `your_tonapi_key_here` with your actual TON API key.

4.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it in two primary ways:

1.  **Connect Your Wallet**:
    Click the "Connect TON Wallet" button. This uses `tonconnect/ui-react` to securely connect your preferred TON wallet (e.g., Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet). Once connected, your wallet's address will be automatically loaded, and its dashboard data will be displayed.

2.  **Enter a Wallet Address Manually**:
    In the "Enter Wallet Address" input field, you can paste any valid TON wallet address. Press "Search" to fetch and display the blockchain data for that specific address. This is useful for exploring public addresses without connecting your own wallet.

Upon successful input or connection, the dashboard will populate with:

- **Real-time Balance**: Your current TON balance and account status.
- **Recent Transactions**: A list of the latest transactions, including incoming/outgoing transfers, fees, and timestamps.
- **Jetton Assets**: An overview of all fungible tokens (Jettons) held by the wallet, with their balances and USD values where available.
- **NFT Collection**: A gallery of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) owned by the address, with interactive previews for details.

You can refresh the data at any time by clicking the refresh icon on the Balance Card.

## ‚ú® Features
